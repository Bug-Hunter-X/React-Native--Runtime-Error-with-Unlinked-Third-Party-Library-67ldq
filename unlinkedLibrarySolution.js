To solve this, ensure that the third-party library is correctly linked to your React Native project. This often involves using the React Native link command (if supported by the library) or manually modifying your native Android (build.gradle) and iOS (Podfile) project files to add necessary dependencies. For example, if you're using a library called `react-native-some-library`, you might need to perform the following steps:

1. **Check Library Documentation:** The documentation for `react-native-some-library` should provide explicit instructions for linking. Follow these steps carefully.  The steps are likely to involve something like `npx react-native link react-native-some-library` or manual edits of your native project configuration.
2. **Manual Linking (if needed):** If the automatic linking fails or is not available, manually add the library to your native Android (in `android/app/build.gradle`) and iOS (in `ios/{YourAppName}/Podfile`) projects. This typically involves adding import statements, bridging headers, and updating native dependencies.
3. **Clean and Rebuild:** After linking, perform a clean and rebuild of your project. This ensures that the changes are correctly reflected in your app. 

Note: The specific linking steps depend heavily on the library in use. Always refer to the library's documentation for accurate linking instructions.
