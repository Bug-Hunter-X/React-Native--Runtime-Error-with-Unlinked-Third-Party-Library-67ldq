This error occurs when using a third-party library that is not properly linked or configured within your React Native project.  It often manifests as a runtime error, not a compile-time error, meaning your code might build successfully but crash when the problematic library is accessed.  The exact error message can vary, but you might encounter something like `undefined is not an object (evaluating 'RNSomeLibrary.someMethod')` or a similar error indicating a missing or incorrect module.
